This past semester, I and some of my friends developed an iPhone application that is capable of detecting money using the built in camera. We entered this application as our Senior Design Project and I am happy to say that we won best project this year.

I will be posting more information regarding technical aspects of the project for those who want to experiment with iOS and OpenCV. But, for now, here is a link to our facebook page where we will be posting more images, videos, and information regarding the project and the iPhone release date.
